## Working on

I'm currently working on language learning app called 'Sīc locūtus'. Trying to get it stable and using AI to fill up content. Yeah, I'm not big fun of AI (or how I call it - supperstatistical engine), but it suggested main points and I just improve on that.

Also I'm working on some suckless libraries for myself.
